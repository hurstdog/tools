maketime
========
A library for reading a google calendar and providing some statistics about how
much time is in meetings and non-work time.

Usage
-----
Follow the instructions on the Calendar API quickstart
[here](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/quickstart/go) to
create a `client_secret.json` file and run the demo. Then call the functions in
